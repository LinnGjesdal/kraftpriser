# This vignette was created as part of the home exersises in the R course, where the topic was packages.

# I have created a package that is used to load data through an API to Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat (NVE), and then the data is used to create a data frame that complies data for hydro power production per power station.

# Further, the package uses simple tests to control that the data loads to the data frame with the correct dimensions and variable types.
